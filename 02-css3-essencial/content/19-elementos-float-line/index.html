                        Cafe Townsend's visionary chef leads the way in a culinary revolution.
                        Proclaimed by many to be the best chef in the world today,
                        Chef Bienni blends earthy seasonal flavors and bold ingredients to create exquisite contemporary
                        cuisine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The name Cafe Townsend comes from our first restaurant,
                        located in a historic building on Townsend Street in San Francisco,
                        where we opened the doors in 1985.
                        We've replicated the elegant interior, exceptional service,
                        and world-class cuisine in our restaurants around the country.
